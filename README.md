## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/your-repository-name` with your actual GitHub repository details)*

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5
    ```

3.  **Ensure Scrcpy is installed:**
    * **Windows:** If Scrcpy is not found, the application will offer to download it. Otherwise, download it from the [official Scrcpy GitHub page](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases) and add it to your PATH.
    * **Linux:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt install scrcpy  # Debian/Ubuntu
        sudo dnf install scrcpy  # Fedora
        sudo pacman -S scrcpy    # Arch Linux
        ```
    * **macOS:**
        ```bash
        brew install scrcpy
        ```

4.  **Ensure DroidCam is installed (Optional):**
    * Download and install DroidCam from [dev47apps.com](https://www.dev47apps.com/) on your computer and phone.
    * Ensure the DroidCam command-line tool (e.g., `droidcam-cli`) is in your PATH.

5.  **Ensure ADB is installed and in PATH:**
    * Download Android SDK Platform Tools from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and add ADB to your PATH.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

    * If using a wireless connection, check "TCP/IP connection" and enter your phone's IP address and port (e.g., `192.168.1.100:5555`). You might need to enable wireless ADB on your phone first (`adb tcpip 5555`).
    * Click "START SCRCPY".
3.  **DroidCam Tab:**
    * Ensure the DroidCam app is running on your phone and it's on the same WiFi network.
    * Optionally, click "Detect Phone IP (via USB)" to find your phone's IP if connected via USB with debugging enabled.
